.Sh PARAMETERS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Broadly, OpenGLUT operates in two modes.  At any
given time, it is either in menu mode (with a popup
menu display, possibly with subitems) or it is
not.
.Pp
When moving from non-menu to menu status,
.Bf Sy
 callback
.Ef
 (if defined) will be called with
.Bf Sy
 GLUT_MENU_IN_USE
.Ef
 .  Conversely, when moving
from menu to non-menu status,
.Bf Sy
 callback
.Ef
 (if defined) will be called with
.Bf Sy
 GLUT_MENU_NOT_IN_USE
.Ef
 .
.Pp
This differs from glutMenuStateFunc() in that
.Bf Sy
 callback
.Ef
 is also given the 
.Bf Sy
 x
.Ef
 and 
.Bf Sy
 y
.Ef
 
coordinates of the mouse when the menu state
transition took place.
.Pp
This callback is bound to 
.Bf Em
 both
.Ef
  the
.Bf Li
 current window
.Ef
  and
the 
.Bf Li
 current menu
.Ef
 .
.Pp
.Sh BUGS
Your callback is not actually called presently.

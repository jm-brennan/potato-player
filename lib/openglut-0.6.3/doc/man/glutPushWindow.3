.Sh NAME
.Nm glutPushWindow
.Nd Request to lower the current window to the bottom.
.Sh LIBRARY
OpenGLUT - window
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openglut.h
.Ft  void
.Fn glutPushWindow "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function requests that the 
.Bf Li
 current window
.Ef
  be ``pushed''
to the back.
.Pp
A window can be in front of or behind other windows, as determined
by the z-order from front to back.  Top-level OpenGLUT windows
can be placed at the front or back of the z-order by means of
the glutPopWindow() and glutPushWindow() API functions.
.Pp
A z-order also applies to the subwindows of a top-level window.
While the z-order of top-level windows can usually be
adjusted by the user, subwindow z-order is controlled entirely
by the application.
.Pp
There may not be an immediate effect to this function.  Wait for
the glutWindowStatusFunc() callback to tell you about whatever
obscured/visible status your window achieves.
.Pp
.Sh CAVEATS
The z-order of top-level windows is ultimately managed by the windowing system.  Therefore, a push or pop request by an OpenGLUT application may not necessarily succeed or take immediate effect.
.Pp
Not applicable to offscreen windows.

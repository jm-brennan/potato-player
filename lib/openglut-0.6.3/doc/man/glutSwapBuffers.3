.Dd
.Sh NAME
.Nm glutSwapBuffers
.Nd Swaps the buffers for the current window.
.Sh LIBRARY
OpenGLUT - window
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openglut.h
.Ft  void
.Fn glutSwapBuffers "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function signals to OpenGLUT that you are done drawing
to the 
.Bf Li
 current window
.Ef
  for now.  If your window is
double-buffered (
.Bf Sy
 GLUT_DOUBLE
.Ef
 param to glutInitDisplayMode()),
then OpenGLUT will swap the front buffer with the back buffer.
.Pp
This also computes your current frame-rate and prints the result
on 
.Bf Sy
 stderr
.Ef
 if indicated by the 
.Bf Sy
 GLUT_FPS
.Ef
 environment
variable.  The computed value is not necessarily the
total frame rate, if you have multiple windows, as the
statistic is the total number of buffer-swaps for the
entire program.
.Pp
.Sh CAVEATS
This function has no effect if your window is 
.Bf Sy
 GLUT_SINGLE
.Ef
 .
.Pp
Frame rate is only calculated for double-buffered windows.
.Pp
.Sh TODO
How does this interact with overlays?
.Pp
Consider making 
.Bf Sy
 GLUT_FPS
.Ef
 keep per-window stats in a multi-window program.

.Sh NAME
.Nm glutMainLoopEvent
.Nd Dispatches all pending events.
.Sh LIBRARY
OpenGLUT - mainloop
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openglut.h
.Ft  void
.Fn glutMainLoopEvent "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The general outline of this function is to first drain
the queue of windowsystem events, in most cases dispatching
each as it is found.  After the queue is empty, we check
for timer-based events, coalesced window events (e.g.,
redisplays), and windows that need to be closed.
.Pp
The cross-reference section for this function's
documentation should ideally contain every
callback, but the list would be tediously long and
prone to omissions.
.Pp
.Sh CAVEATS
Does not necessarily dispatch events that are received 
.Bf Li
 after
.Ef
  this function starts processing.
.Pp
At first glance, this function may not seem to afford any new capability that you couldn't get with an idle callback or glutLeaveMainLoop().  However there are other GLUT-like libraries that may have their own window event processing loops.  Having glutMainLoopEvent() allows you to ask OpenGLUT to do its work in a batch, then return to whatever processing the other library (or libraries) require.

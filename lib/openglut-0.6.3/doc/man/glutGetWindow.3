OpenGLUT - window
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openglut.h
.Ft  int
.Fn glutGetWindow "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
glutGetWindow() returns the 
.Bf Li
 window id
.Ef
  of the
.Bf Li
 current window
.Ef
 .  This is useful, e.g., if you have
a generic function that is used with several windows and
it needs to temporarily change to another window.
(There is no window stack for you to use with pushes and
pops.  Do not be confused by glutPushWindow() and glutPopWindow();
those pushes and pops are 
.Bf Em
 not
.Ef
  stack-related!)
.Pp
One cause for the function to return 0 is if you have
called glutDestroyWindow() on the 
.Bf Li
 current window
.Ef
  and have
done nothing to set a new window as current.

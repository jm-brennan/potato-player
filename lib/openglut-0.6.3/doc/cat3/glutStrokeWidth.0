     [1mglutStrokeWidth[22m([4mvoid[24m [4m*fontID[24m, [4mint[24m [4mcharacter[24m);

[1mPARAMETERS[0m
      [4mfontID[24m     A GLUT stroked font identifier.

      [4mcharacter[24m  A character code.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function reports how far the model space origin will advance if you
     putput this  [1mcharacter  [22min the font named by  [1mfontID.   [22mNot all letters
     will use their full width, especially in fixed-width fonts.

     Returns 0 if  [1mcharacter  [22mis out of range or if the  [1mfontID  [22mis invalid.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Historically, this function has been described as returning a pixel-
     width, but was implemented to return the width in model-space units,
     rounded to integers. GLUT never resolved this, and freeglut duplicated
     the confusion. OpenGLUT has decided to stay in model-space and to return
     the unrounded floating point value. An unreleased GLUT 3.8 was supposed
     to include glutStrokeWidthf() and glutStrokeLengthf() (note the *f suf-
     fixes), but that is not in wide use.

[1mTODO[0m
     Determine if any glyphs are either wider than this function or if they
     render outside of the bounding box given by  (0,-descent)   by
     (width,height-descent)  .

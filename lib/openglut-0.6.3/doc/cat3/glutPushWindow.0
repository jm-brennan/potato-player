[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function requests that the  current window   be ``pushed'' to the
     back.

     A window can be in front of or behind other windows, as determined by the
     z-order from front to back.  Top-level OpenGLUT windows can be placed at
     the front or back of the z-order by means of the glutPopWindow() and
     glutPushWindow() API functions.

     A z-order also applies to the subwindows of a top-level window.  While
     the z-order of top-level windows can usually be adjusted by the user,
     subwindow z-order is controlled entirely by the application.

     There may not be an immediate effect to this function.  Wait for the
     glutWindowStatusFunc() callback to tell you about whatever obscured/visi-
     ble status your window achieves.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     The z-order of top-level windows is ultimately managed by the windowing
     system.  Therefore, a push or pop request by an OpenGLUT application may
     not necessarily succeed or take immediate effect.

     Not applicable to offscreen windows.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function reports the mouse position when the mouse is dragged start-
     ing from within your window.  (``Dragging'' occurs when you press one or
     more mouse buttons in one of your OpenGLUT windows, and then move the
     mouse around.)

     This callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Events are reported until the mouse button is released, even if the mouse
     leaves the window.

     Windows created via glutCreateMenuWindow() always cascade keyboard and
     mouse events to their parent.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Requests that the window system change the title of the icon (or what-
     ever) that is displayed when the  current window   is in iconified mode.

     As discussed under glutIconifyWindow(), most window systems allow a win-
     dow to be placed in some kind of minimized, or iconified, state.  In that
     state, the normal interior of the window is likely to be obscured, and
     the only clue about the window contents may be the window title.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Effect is system-dependant.

     There Exactly what "iconified" means is system dependant.  Iconification
     may not be supported, or the title may not be available---or legible.
     Avoid putting essential information into the icon title.

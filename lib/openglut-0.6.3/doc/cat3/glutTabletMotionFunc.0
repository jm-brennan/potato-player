[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function registers a  [1mcallback  [22mby which OpenGLUT reports a puck or
     stylus position in the range of [0, 2000] along the  [1mx  [22mand  [1my  [22maxes.

     The callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     OpenGLUT does not implement tablet support.

     This API does not include tilt information.

[1mTODO[0m
     We might want to add support for this sooner or later. Although a tablet
     could also be generalized as a mouse. There are relatively cheap AipTek
     HyperPen tablets, and slightly less cheap Wacom tablets on many store
     shelves.

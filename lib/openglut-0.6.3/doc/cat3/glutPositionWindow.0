[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The glutPositionWindow() function requests that the window system posi-
     tion a top-level or subwindow relative to the top-left corner.  Subwin-
     dows are typically resized and repositioned in response to window resize
     events.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     The position of top-level windows is ultimately determined by the window-
     ing system.  Therefore, a position request by an OpenGLUT application may
     not necessarily succeed.

     May not take immediate effect; wait for the callback.

     Not applicable to offscreen windows.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     glutShowWindow() requests that the window system make the  current window
       visible.

     This is generally not necessary.  When you create a window, it will nor-
     mally become visible.  Unless you specifically hide it, it will remain
     visible.  Though visible, of course, it may be covered by other windows;
     that would be an issue for window stacking order not visibility.

     When, and if, your window's visibility status changes, you may find out
     via a glutWindowStatusFunc() callback.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The glutReshapeWindow() function adjusts the width and height of the
     current window  , if it is an onscreen top-level or subwindow.  Subwin-
     dows are typically resized and repositioned in response to window resize
     events.

     The window system may delay or even alter your request.  Use the glutRe-
     shapeFunc() callback registration for the window if you want

     If you try to make a subwindow smaller than its parent, the parent will
     not grow to accomodate the child.

[1mTODO[0m
     Add support for offscreen windows.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function registers a  [1mcallback  [22mby which you receive reports a
     tablet button status feature.  Buttons are reported with  [1mbutton  [22min the
     range 1 to glutDeviceGet(  [1mGLUT_NUM_TABLET_BUTTONS).    state  [22mis either
     [1mGLUT_UP  [22mor  [1mGLUT_DOWN  [22mand  [1mx  [22mand  [1my  [22mare the tablet coordinate (see
     glutTabletMotionFunc() for the bounds of  [1mx  [22mand  [1my).[0m

     The callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     OpenGLUT does not implement tablet support.

     Buttons are  [4mnot[24m   pressure-sensitive.

[1mTODO[0m
     We might want to add support for this sooner or later. Although a tablet
     could also be generalized as a mouse. There are relatively cheap AipTek
     HyperPen tablets, and slightly less cheap Wacom tablets on many store
     shelves.

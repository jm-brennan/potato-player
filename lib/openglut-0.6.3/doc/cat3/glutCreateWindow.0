[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function sends a request for a window to be constructed.  OpenGLUT
     immediately constructs a data structure to track further events with the
     window, on the theory that eventually the window manager will get back to
     us with a real window.  This allows us to begin registering callbacks im-
     mediately.

     In fact, you  [4mmust[24m   register a display callback via glutDisplayFunc()
     before you enter glutMainLoop().

     For onscreen windows, you should not depend upon the window concretely
     existing or being visibile until you are told that it exists and is visi-
     ble via a registered callback.

     The return value is an  [1mint.    [22mIt should be positive for valid windows
     or 0 if failure occurred for some reason (Though traditional GLUT tends
     to bail out and abort rather than returning errors.)  The integer is your
      window id  .  Old GLUT promises that these integers are ``small''; we do
     not reuse old  id  s, but do produce them sequentially.

     You can change the title later via glutSetWindowTitle().

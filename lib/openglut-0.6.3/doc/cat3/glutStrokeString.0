[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function draws a  [1mstring  [22min the font indicated by  [1mfontID.   [22mIt is
     almost   equivalent to calling glutStrokeCharacter() on each character in
     the  [1mstring,  [22msuccessively.  Mostly, it is a convenience function to hide
     the loop, and to treat \n as a special symbol rather than a normal glyph.

     The first character displays at the current model space origin,  The ori-
     gin changes by successive translations.

     The newline character, \n (ASCII LF) is treated as a newline and resets
     the origin horizontally while advancing the line 1 font-height down the
     y-axis.

     Does nothing if:
      -  [1mfontID  [22mis out of range.
      -  [1mstring  [22mis  [1mNULL[0m
      -  [1mstring  [22mis empty

     Unlike glutBitmapString(), there is little performance advantage to using
     glutStrokeString() as compared with calling glutStrokeCharacter() your-
     self for every character.

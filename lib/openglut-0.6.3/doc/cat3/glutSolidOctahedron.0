[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function draws a regular, solid 8-sided polyhedron centered at the
     origin.  The vertices are at (+/-1, 0, 0), (0, +/-1, 0), (0, 0, +/-1).

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     We visit the same vertices the same number of times as in the wire octa-
     hedron, but the order is different.

     Sets the  current window   to  [1mID.[0m

     All OpenGL rendering goes to the  current window  .  Many OpenGLUT func-
     tions also implicitly use the  current window  .

     Many OpenGLUT callback operations are tied to a window.  When your call-
     back is invoked, OpenGLUT will set that particular window to be the  cur-
     rent window  .  However, some callbacks---such as that registered via
     glutIdleFunc()---do not have associated windows.  If a callback is not
     associated to a particular window, then when OpenGLUT invokes that call-
     back you should  [4malways[24m   use glutSetWindow() to select the appropriate
     window before doing any OpenGL rendering or doing any OpenGLUT window-re-
     lated operations.

     There may be cases when you can get away with assuming that the  current
     window   is unchanged since some prior time, but OpenGLUT has consider-
     able liberaty with respect to when it invokes your functions.  Also, your
     program may add more windows or more operations on other windows as you
     develop it.

     Lastly, this is a convenient way to select among multiple windows for
     drawing without actually waiting for that window's display callback.
     Simply set the  current window   and draw immediately.  This is not al-
     ways advisable, but may be practical.

     It is an error to set the  current window   to a non-existant window
     (e.g., one that you have closed).  A warning will be printed on  [1mstderr[0m
     if you try to do so, and the  current window   should be unchanged.

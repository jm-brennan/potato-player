[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Forces the OpenGLUT joystick code to poll your joystick(s) and to call
     your joystick callbacks with the result.  The operation completes, in-
     cluding callbacks, before glutForceJoystickFunc() returns.

[1mBUGS[0m
     The original WINCE import used a #if to turn this function off.  That is
     wrong.  The proper way to handle the joystick code is to generate "null"
     events.  The WINCE code needs to be fixed in og_joystick.c, not here.

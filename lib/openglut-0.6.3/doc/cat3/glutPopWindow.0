[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Request that the  current window   be brought to the top.

     A window can be in front of or behind other windows, as determined by the
     z-order from front to back.  Top-level OpenGLUT windows can be placed at
     the front or back of the z-order by means of the glutPopWindow() and
     glutPushWindow() API functions.

     A z-order also applies to the subwindows of a top-level window.  While
     the z-order of top-level windows can usually be adjusted by the user,
     subwindow z-order is controlled entirely by the application.

     If this has any effect on your window's visibility, you should receive a
     glutWindowStatusFunc() callback and a glutDisplayFunc() callback.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     The z-order of top-level windows is ultimately managed by the windowing
     system.  Therefore, a push or pop request by an OpenGLUT application may
     not necessarily succeed or take immediate effect.

     Not applicable to offscreen windows.

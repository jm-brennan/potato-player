[1mPARAMETERS[0m
      [4mcallback[24m     Client menu destruction hook.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     When a menu is destroyed, OpenGLUT will call this hook, if defined on
     that menu.

     This callback is  [4mnot[24m   bound to any window.

     This callback  [4mis[24m   bound to a specific menu.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     For emphasis, we repeat: This callback does not bind to any window.

[1mTODO[0m
     What on Earth is rationale for this feature? Menus should only be de-
     stroyed when we ask them to be destroyed, or when their window is de-
     stroyed. In the former case, we already know that the menu is being de-
     stroyed because we requested it.  In the latter case, it is easy for the
     client to track that if they care, via window-destruction callbacks.

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1m#include <openglut.h>[0m

     [4mGLfloat[0m
     [1mglutStrokeHeight[22m([4mvoid[24m [4m*fontID[24m);

[1mPARAMETERS[0m
      [4mfontID[24m     A GLUT stroked font identifier.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function reports the height of a font, given by  [1mfontID,  [22mas a
     global characteristic of that font.

     Returns 0 if  [1mfontID  [22mis invalid.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Does  not   report the height used by individual characters.  This may
     limit its usefulness; perhaps we should change it?  (And/or add a new
     function.)

[1mTODO[0m
     We have discussed adding a "font descender" query. We should go ahead and
     do it.

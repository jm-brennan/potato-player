[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Even if a window is ``open'', it need not be visible.  It may be conve-
     nient to hide a window rather than to close it, if you want to re-display
     the window at the same location and size, later.  Redefining all of the
     OpenGLUT features of a window and adding its  window id   to your track-
     ing when re-opening a window may also be bothersome.  So, rather than de-
     stroying it, you can simply ask for it to be hidden.

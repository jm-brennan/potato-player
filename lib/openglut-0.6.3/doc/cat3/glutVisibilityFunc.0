[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     OpenGLUT may call this function when your window's visbility status has
     changed.   [1mstatus  [22mcan take on two values:  [1mGLUT_NOT_VISIBLE  [22mor
     [1mGLUT_VISIBLE  [22m.  If any pixel of your window (including descendants) is
     visible, your window is  [1mGLUT_VISIBLE  [22m.

     The callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     This is not a polling mechanism.  You are only informed of transitions
     that OpenGLUT observes while your callback is in place.

     This function appears to be superceded by glutWindowStatusFunc().

     This callback is mutually exclusive of glutWindowStatusFunc().

      [4mcallback[24m     Client window status hook.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     When the visibility status of your window changes, OpenGLUT either in-
     vokes the  [1mcallback  [22mregistered by this function or the Visibility  [1mcall-[0m
     [1mback---or  [22mneither, if you have not registered either callback.

     This differs from glutVisbilityFunc() in that the callback has three
     states, rather than two, that it may receive.  These states are:

      -  [1mGLUT_VISIBLE        [22m(every pixel visible)
      -  [1mGLUT_FULLY_COVERED  [22m(every pixel obscured)
      -  [1mGLUT_HIDDEN         [22m(intermediate)

     The callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Makes glutVisibilityFunc() obsolete.

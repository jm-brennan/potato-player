     Does not work on all window managers.

     Sends the Icewm style message to all window managers (KDE, twm, blackbox,
     ratpoison, amiwm, and whatever others you have).  Can we detect Icewm re-
     liably and only send the Icewm formatted message for Icewm?  Possibbly
     harmless as it stands, but looks wrong.

     Can a glutGet() be defined to tell us whether a window can be made to
     stay on top?  Or whether a window has (successfully) been marked for
     staying on top?

     Should walk the tree of menus and glutPopWindow() (or all windows that
     are of menu-window type?).

     Investigate making a workalike variant using glutPopWindow() to mimic the
     feature where not directly supported.

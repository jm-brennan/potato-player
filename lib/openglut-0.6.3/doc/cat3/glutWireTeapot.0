[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function draws the standard Teapot in wireframe using OpenGL evalua-
     tors.  This is the classic "Utah Teapot" of computer graphics.  The base
     should lie in the xy-plane with "up" being along the positive z axis.

     This is derived from SGI code.  It should also be the same as the teapot
     modeled by Martin Newell in 1975.

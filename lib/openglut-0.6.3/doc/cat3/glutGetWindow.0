[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     glutGetWindow() returns the  window id   of the  current window  .  This
     is useful, e.g., if you have a generic function that is used with several
     windows and it needs to temporarily change to another window.  (There is
     no window stack for you to use with pushes and pops.  Do not be confused
     by glutPushWindow() and glutPopWindow(); those pushes and pops are  [4mnot[0m
     stack-related!)

     One cause for the function to return 0 is if you have called glutDestroy-
     Window() on the  current window   and have done nothing to set a new win-
     dow as current.

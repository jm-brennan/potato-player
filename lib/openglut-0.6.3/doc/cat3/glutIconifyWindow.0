[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Most window systems have some kind of ``minimized'' or ``iconified''
     state for windows.  All systems currently supported by OpenGLUT do so.
     The exact meaning of iconification is somewhat system-dependant, but this
     makes a request of the window system to place the window into this state.

     Graphic output is usually suspended in this form.  User input may be par-
     tially or wholly suspended.

     If and when your window is iconified by the window system, it may be uni-
     conified at any time by the system.  This usually happens at the request
     of a user.  Because of this, you should not use this function to hide a
     window.  Rather, it is to help unclutter the user's display, and is more
     or less consensual with the user.  Use glutHideWindow() if you want to
     hide the window entirely.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Applies only to onscreen, top-level windows.

     Not guaranteed to have any effect; effect may be arbitrarily delayed.

     There is no callback that specifically tells you when (or if) your window
     is iconified.

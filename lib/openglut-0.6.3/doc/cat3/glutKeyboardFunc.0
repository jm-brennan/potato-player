[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This callback registration allows you to handle traditional ASCII key-
     board input.  A general rule of thumb is that if a key has a common ASCII
     code, then OpenGLUT assigns that code to the key and calls the Keyboard
     [1mcallback  [22mwith the ASCII code in the  [1mkey  [22mparameter.  For other keys,
     you must use glutSpecialFunc().  Not all keys can be reported by OpenG-
     LUT.

     As a convenience, the mouse coordinates, relative to your window, are
     also returned.

     This callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     This function is not very international-friendly.

     Windows created via glutCreateMenuWindow() always cascade keyboard and
     mouse events to their parent.

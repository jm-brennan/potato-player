     [1mglutExtensionSupported[22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*extension[24m);

[1mPARAMETERS[0m
      [4mextension[24m     A string-name of an extension.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Returns 0 if OpenGLUT cannot determine that the requested extension is
     definitely present.  Only checks extensions from glGetString().

[1mTODO[0m
     Wouldn't this be simpler and clearer if we used strtok()?

     Consider an ogWarning() if there is no current rendering context.

     This is an ugly bit of code with 3 return statements, one of which is
     never reached.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     After this function is invoked, the only further event that may be deliv-
     ered for your window is the one for its destruction.  All other events
     should be discarded.

     Once a window has been destroyed, further attempts to use the window
     named by  [1mwindowID  [22mare undefined.  OpenGLUT generally tries to be sensi-
     ble, and should not recycle the dead  [1mwindowID,  [22mbut you should treat a
     destroyed window much like a pointer to deallocated memory and try not to
     use it.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This registers a function with OpenGLUT, which OpenGLUT will invoke when-
     ever the window is reshaped or resized.  Your callback is only invoked
     when the host window system has actually changed the window size.

     The parameters to your callback are the new width and height for your
     window.

     If you do not provide a reshape callback, OpenGLUT will simply call
     glViewport(0,0,  [1mw,   h).[0m

     This callback is bound to the  current window  .

     To ask OpenGLUT about the present dimensions of the  current window  ,
     you can use glutGet().

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Unlike other callbacks, GLUT has an  [4mactive[24m   default behavior if you do
     not set this.   (Most event types passively do nothing if you do not
     specify a callback to handle them.)

     The reshape callback should always be called, if registered, when your
     window is first created.

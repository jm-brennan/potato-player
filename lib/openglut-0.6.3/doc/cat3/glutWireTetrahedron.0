[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function draws a regular, wireframe 4-sided polyhedron centered at
     the origin.  The distance from the origin to the vertices is 1.

     Merge  [1mr0   r1   r2  [22mand  [1mr3  [22minto one array.

     Put the normals into the (or an) array.

     Make the array static const, with file scope, and share with glutSolidTe-
     trahedron().

     Maybe consolidate with the SierpinskySponge?

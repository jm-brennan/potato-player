[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     When a window is destroyed by user-action in traditional GLUT, the appli-
     cation terminates.  In freeglut and OpenGLUT, the application can choose
     to persist and treat the window close event as a normal event.  This
     callback is how that event is transmitted to the application.

     This callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     This function is  [4mexactly[24m   the same as glutWMCloseFunc(), which has been
     deprecated. This function should be used instead.

[1mTODO[0m
     There needs to be some work to rationalize the behavior when a window is
     closed.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     glutInitDisplayMode() allows you to control the mode for subsequent
     OpenGLUT windows.

     Allowable  [1mdisplayMode  [22mis a combination of:

      -  [1mGLUT_RGB[0m
     Red, green, blue framebuffer.

      -  [1mGLUT_RGBA[0m
     Red, green, blue, alpha framebuffer.

      -  [1mGLUT_INDEX[0m
     Indexed color framebuffer.

      -  [1mGLUT_SINGLE[0m
     Single-buffered mode.

      -  [1mGLUT_DOUBLE[0m
     Double-buffered mode.

      -  [1mGLUT_ACCUM[0m
     Accumulation buffer.

      -  [1mGLUT_ALPHA[0m
     Alpha channel.

      -  [1mGLUT_DEPTH[0m
     Depth buffering.

      -  [1mGLUT_STENCIL[0m
     Stencil buffering.

      -  [1mGLUT_MULTISAMPLE[0m
     Multisampling mode. (not always available)

      -  [1mGLUT_STEREO[0m
     Left and right framebuffers.

      -  [1mGLUT_LUMINANCE[0m
     Greyscale color mode.

     Additionally, the following  experimental   features are implemented:

      -  [1mGLUT_OFFSCREEN[0m
     Offscreen windows are very much like onscreen windows that have been
     dragged off of the edge of the screen.  The biggest issue is that off-
     screen windows do not support subwindows.  Other than that, onscreen win-
     dows that are dragged off of the edge may not store graphics that you
     render (while  [1mGLUT_OFFSCREEN  [22mwindows do), and there is no way to drag
     an offscreen window onscreen for user interaction.

      -  [1mGLUT_BORDERLESS[0m
     Borderless windows are very experimental, and their precise behavior is
     not set in stone.  See also glutCreateMenuWindow().

     The following are  defaults  :

      -  [1mGLUT_RGB[0m
      -  [1mGLUT_SINGLE[0m

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Some display mode features were introduced by OpenGLUT.

     Not all features or combinations of features are valid for all platforms.

     There is no way to change the display mode of an open window.

[1mBUGS[0m
      [1mGLUT_OFFSCREEN  [22mwindows do not work with nVidia cards/drivers.  (Both
     Win32 and X11)

      [1mGLUT_BORDERLESS  [22mseems to vary by the window manager on X11, though twm
     (for example) performs very similarly to WIN32. But KDE's window manager
     (for example) does not let you send keystrokes to borderless windows
     without OpenGLUT hacks.

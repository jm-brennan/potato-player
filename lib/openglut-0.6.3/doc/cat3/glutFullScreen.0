[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The glutFullScreen() function resizes the window to cover the entire
     screen and hide window decorations such as title bars and icons.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     The desktop resolution is not affected by a call to glutReshapeWindow()
     or glutFullScreen().

     The size of windows is ultimately determined by the windowing system.
     Therefore, a fullscreen request by an OpenGLUT application may not neces-
     sarily succeed or take immediate effect.

     Not applicable to offscreen or subwindows.

[1mPARAMETERS[0m
      [4mcallback[24m     Client function for normal redisplay event.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Sets the display callback for the  current window  .  All windows, in-
     cluding subwindows,  [4mmust[24m   have a display callback registered.  OpenGLUT
     will call the  [1mcallback  [22mfunction whenever it thinks that the window may
     require updating.

     This callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Unlike most callbacks, it is illegal to try to disable the display call-
     back by setting it to  [1mNULL  [22m.

     Multiple redisplays may be coalesced into a single event for invoking the
      [1mcallback  [22monly once.

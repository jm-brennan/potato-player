[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function allows you to unilaterally tell OpenGLUT that you are done
     and wish to exit.  This is useful if you have also told OpenGLUT to re-
     turn to you rather than to call exit() directly.

[1mTODO[0m
     Could use longjmp(); see oghTakeActionOnWindowClose(). This would let us
     terminate the entire loop immediately.

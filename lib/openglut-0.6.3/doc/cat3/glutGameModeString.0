      [4mstring[24m     A configuration parameter as a string.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Sets the gamemode status according to an undocumented string.

     Glancing at old GLUT 3.7, the freeglut codebase that we inherited does
     not implement more than a single GLUT gamemode ``criteria''. It may not
     even do that much correctly.

     In principle, this code lets you set the video dimensions, rendering
     depth, and video refresh rate.  In practice, the combination that you re-
     quest may be unsupportable and the target host may even refuse to honor
     any such changes.

     If you use this function but do not set all options, the following de-
     faults may be substituted for some values:

      -  [1mwidth  [22m640
      -  [1mheight  [22m480
      -  [1mdepth  [22m16
      -  [1mrefresh  [22m72

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function draws a regular wireframe 8-sided polyhedron centered at
     the origin.  The vertices are at (+/-1, 0, 0), (0, +/-1, 0), (0, 0,
     +/-1).

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     We visit the same vertices the same number of times as for the solid oc-
     tahedron, but the order is different.

     Draws every edge twice.

     The lines have normals, but the normals are from the facets, rather than
     upon the edge.  If you squint too hard, the lighting on a wireframe octa-
     hedron does not look quite right.

[1mTODO[0m
     It may be faster (and look better) to draw each edge once, setting the
     Normal at each edge.  (I don't think that this matters all that much, but
     a lineloop was proposed for the wire Cube for speed.)

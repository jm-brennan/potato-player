[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This is the main driving force for an event-driven OpenGLUT program.  It
     alternates between calling glutMainLoopEvent() to process pending events
     and then either sleeping or calling your idle function (see glutIdle-
     Func()).

     This function  can   return, but GLUT's version of this function never
     returned.  And you must do special things to OpenGLUT to cause OpenGLUT's
     version to return.

     The cross-reference section for this function's documentation should ide-
     ally contain every callback, but the list would be tediously long and
     prone to omissions.

[1mBUGS[0m
     Talking to other message systems (e.g., network layers) can be a bit
     bothersome under the GLUT event model.

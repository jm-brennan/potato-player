[1mPARAMETERS[0m
      [4mfont[24m       A bitmapped font identifier.

      [4mcharacter[24m  A character code.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Returns the horizontal OpenGL raster position offset for a  [1mcharacter  [22min
     a bitmapped  [1mfont.[0m

     It is also an upper bound on the width of the bitmapped glyph for  [1mchar-[0m
     [1macter,  [22mthough not all letters will use their full width, especially
     fixed-width fonts.

     Returns 0 if the  [1mcharacter  [22mis out of the inclusive range [0,255] or if
     the  [1mfont  [22mis invalid.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     In GLUT, some glyphs could render to the left of the starting position,
     in some fonts.  OpenGLUT's fonts all position all of their glyphs to
     start at, or to the right of, the initial position.

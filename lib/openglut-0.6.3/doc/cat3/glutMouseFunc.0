[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Whenever a mouse button is pressed or released in an OpenGLUT window,
     OpenGLUT checks if that window has a mouse-button (Mouse) callback regis-
     tered.  If so, OpenGLUT gives the event to the handler.   [1mbutton  [22mis the
     button number, starting from 0.   [1mstate  [22mis  [1mGLUT_UP  [22mor  [1mGLUT_DOWN  [22mto
     indicate the button's new state.  The other parameters are the mouse co-
     ordinates.

     Mouse wheel motion can be reported as buttons.  If you do not request
     otherwise, a wheel spun forward will act like a button clicking down, im-
     mediately followed by clicking up.  Spinning the same wheel backward will
     act like a different button clicking.  Mouse wheel pseudo-buttons are
     added after all real buttons.

     While the button is held and the mouse is dragged, you receive mouse-mo-
     tion events (glutMotionFunc()), even if the mouse is dragged out of the
     window.

     This callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Reporting the wheel as buttons is actually inherited from X. freeglut
     added code to support this on WIN32.  OpenGLUT inherited that support
     from freeglut.

     Old GLUT defines the symbols  [1mGLUT_LEFT_BUTTON,   GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON,  [22mand
      [1mGLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON.   [22mHowever, mice can have more than 3 buttons, so
     these symbols are deprecated.

     Windows created via glutCreateMenuWindow() always cascade keyboard and
     mouse events to their parent.

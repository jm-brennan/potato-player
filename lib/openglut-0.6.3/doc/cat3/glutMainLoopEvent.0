[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The general outline of this function is to first drain the queue of win-
     dowsystem events, in most cases dispatching each as it is found.  After
     the queue is empty, we check for timer-based events, coalesced window
     events (e.g., redisplays), and windows that need to be closed.

     The cross-reference section for this function's documentation should ide-
     ally contain every callback, but the list would be tediously long and
     prone to omissions.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Does not necessarily dispatch events that are received  after   this
     function starts processing.

     At first glance, this function may not seem to afford any new capability
     that you couldn't get with an idle callback or glutLeaveMainLoop().  How-
     ever there are other GLUT-like libraries that may have their own window
     event processing loops.  Having glutMainLoopEvent() allows you to ask
     OpenGLUT to do its work in a batch, then return to whatever processing
     the other library (or libraries) require.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function will return whatever  [1mvoid*  [22mvalue is associated with the
     current window   via glutSetWindowData().  This is  [1mNULL  [22mif you did not
     associate a pointer with your window.  This can be useful in a situation
     where you have a single callback function performing services for many
     windows.  You  [4mcould[24m   keep track of the  window id  s in a global list
     and search for the  current window   in that list.  But this is quicker
     than searching a data structure, and allows you to avoid the use of glob-
     als for this.

      [4mcallback[24m     Client menu status hook.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Broadly, OpenGLUT operates in two modes.  At any given time, it is either
     in menu mode (with a popup menu display, possibly with subitems) or it is
     not.

     When moving from non-menu to menu status,  [1mcallback  [22m(if defined) will be
     called with  [1mGLUT_MENU_IN_USE  [22m.  Conversely, when moving from menu to
     non-menu status,  [1mcallback  [22m(if defined) will be called with
     [1mGLUT_MENU_NOT_IN_USE  [22m.

     This callback is bound to  [4mboth[24m   the  current window   and the  current
     menu  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Obsolete.  Depcreated.

[1mBUGS[0m
     Your callback is not actually called presently.

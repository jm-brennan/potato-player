     [1m#include <openglut.h>[0m

     [4mvoid[0m
     [1mglutSwapBuffers[22m([4mvoid[24m);

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This function signals to OpenGLUT that you are done drawing to the  cur-
     rent window   for now.  If your window is double-buffered (  [1mGLUT_DOUBLE[0m
     param to glutInitDisplayMode()), then OpenGLUT will swap the front buffer
     with the back buffer.

     This also computes your current frame-rate and prints the result on
     [1mstderr  [22mif indicated by the  [1mGLUT_FPS  [22menvironment variable.  The com-
     puted value is not necessarily the total frame rate, if you have multiple
     windows, as the statistic is the total number of buffer-swaps for the en-
     tire program.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     This function has no effect if your window is  [1mGLUT_SINGLE  [22m.

     Frame rate is only calculated for double-buffered windows.

[1mTODO[0m
     How does this interact with overlays?

     Consider making  [1mGLUT_FPS  [22mkeep per-window stats in a multi-window pro-
     gram.

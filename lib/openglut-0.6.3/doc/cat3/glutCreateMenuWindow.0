[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     This is a highly experimental function.  It creates a menu-like window,
     of requested dimensions, and at a position relative to your current win-
     dow.

     The documentation for this function is currently the OpenGLUT Menu Window
     proposal.  Variance from that proposal may generally be explained by the
     fact that this feature is highly experimental.  It may also be explained
     by the fact that the implementation may simply be incomplete.

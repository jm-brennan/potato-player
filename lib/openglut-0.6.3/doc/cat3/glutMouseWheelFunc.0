[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     If the mouse wheel is spun over your (sub)window, OpenGLUT will, in the-
     ory, report this via the MouseWheel callback.   [1mwheel  [22mis the wheel num-
     ber,  [1mdirection  [22mis +/- 1, and  [1mx  [22mand  [1my  [22mare the mouse coordinates.

     If you do not register a wheel callback, wheel events will be reported as
     mouse buttons.

     This callback is bound to the  current window  .

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Due to lack of information about the mouse, it is impossible to implement
     this correctly on X at this time.  Use of this function limits the porta-
     bility of your application.  (This feature  [4mdoes[24m   work on X, just not
     reliably.)  You are encouraged to use the standard, reliable mouse-button
     reporting, rather than wheel events.

     Windows created via glutCreateMenuWindow() always cascade keyboard and
     mouse events to their parent.

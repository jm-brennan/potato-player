[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Given a function name, searches for the function (or "procedure", hence
     "Proc") in internal tables.  If the function is found, a pointer to the
     function is returned.  If the function is not found,  [1mNULL  [22mis returned.

     In addition to an internal OpenGLUT table, this function will also con-
     sult glX (on X systems) or wgl (on WIN32 and WINCE), if the OpenGLUT ta-
     bles do not have the requested function.  It should return any OpenGL,
     glX, or wgl function if those functions are available.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     The code makes no effort towards efficiency. It is advised that you cache
     the pointer retrieved from this function if you need a certain function
     repeatedly.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     Retrieves some system-specific information about attached devices.  Sup-
     ported device queries are:

      -  [1mGLUT_HAS_JOYSTICK[0m
     Return non-zero if there is a joystick.

      -  [1mGLUT_HAS_KEYBOARD[0m
     Return non-zero if there is a keyboard.

      -  [1mGLUT_HAS_MOUSE[0m
     Return non-zero if there is a mouse.

      -  [1mGLUT_HAS_SPACEBALL[0m
     Return non-zero if there is a spaceball.

      -  [1mGLUT_JOYSTICK_AXES[0m
     Return the number of axes for the joystick.

      -  [1mGLUT_JOYSTICK_POLL_RATE[0m
     Return the rate (in GLUT timer ticks?) at which the joystick is polled.

      -  [1mGLUT_NUM_MOUSE_BUTTONS[0m
     Return the number of buttons that the user's mouse has.

      -  [1mGLUT_OWNS_JOYSTICK[0m
     Return non-zero if OpenGLUT believes that it has successfully acquired
     access to the joystick.

      -  [1mGLUT_DEVICE_IGNORE_KEY_REPEAT[0m
     Return non-zero if the  current window   is set to disable key repeating.

      -  [1mGLUT_DEVICE_KEY_REPEAT[0m
     Described as returning the key repeat rate in one place, but actually re-
     turns a key repeat mode.

      -  [1mGLUT_HAS_DIAL_AND_BUTTON_BOX[0m
     Return non-zero if a dials-and-buttons box is present.

      -  [1mGLUT_HAS_TABLET[0m
     Return non-zero if a tablet is present.

      -  [1mGLUT_NUM_BUTTON_BOX_BUTTONS[0m
     Return the number of buttons on a dials-and-buttons box, if any.

      -  [1mGLUT_NUM_DIALS[0m
     Return the number of dials on a dials-and-buttons box, if any.

      -  [1mGLUT_NUM_SPACEBALL_BUTTONS[0m
     Return the number of buttons on a spaceball, if any.

      -  [1mGLUT_NUM_TABLET_BUTTONS[0m
     Return the number of buttons on a tablet, if any.

[1mTODO[0m
     Only supports querying for one joystick.

     Consider moving to a table-based approach rather than a switch(), letting
     us move to modular functions.

[1mBUGS[0m
     Keyboards are optional, but OpenGLUT doesn't detect their absence.

     Mice are optional, but OpenGLUT is only able to check for them under
     WIN32.

     Mice can have a varying number of buttons, but OpenGLUT assumes exactly 3
     on UNIX_X11.

     Not all joystick queries are implemented yet.

      [1mGLUT_DEVICE_KEY_REPEAT  [22mreturns the key repeat mode, but the comment
     says it returns the  rate  .

     Some things, like joystick poll rates, seem to have insufficient context.
     Which joystick?  Which window? Maybe we assume the  current window   and
     the current joystick (or the first one)?

      [1mGLUT_DEVICE_KEY_REPEAT  [22mshould probably return  [1mogState.KeyRepeat.[0m

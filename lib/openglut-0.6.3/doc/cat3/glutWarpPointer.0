     Warping means moving, just as if the user had manually moved the mouse.
     This can generate mouse-motion callbacks. If your callback then moves the
     pointer again, you may end up in an endless loop.  There is some discus-
     sion about changing this, but at present this is just a caveat for you,
     the user, to be aware of.

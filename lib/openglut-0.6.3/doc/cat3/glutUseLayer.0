[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1m#include <openglut.h>[0m

     [4mvoid[0m
     [1mglutUseLayer[22m([4mGLenum[24m [4mlayer[24m);

[1mPARAMETERS[0m
      [4mlayer[24m     Whether to be in a layer or in the normal window.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     By default, OpenGLUT operates in "normal" mode, with respect to layers.
     If you have a layer open and wish to operate on the layer, you must use
     glutUseLayer().

      [1mlayer  [22mcan take on the following values, indicating the layer mode to
     use:

      -  [1mGLUT_NORMAL[0m
      -  [1mGLUT_LAYER[0m

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     Unimplemented.

     It is unclear what the consequences are if you are in  [1mGLUT_OVERLAY  [22mmode
     and switch to another (or the same) window via glutSetWindow().  What if
     the target has a layer?  What if it doesn't?

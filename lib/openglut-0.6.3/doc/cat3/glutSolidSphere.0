[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The glutSolidSphere() function draws a shaded sphere centered at the ori-
     gin.  The surface is created from quadrangles (except for triangles as
     degenerate quads at the poles) in a longitude/latitude pattern.  The
     equatorial great circle lies in the xy-plane and is centered on the ori-
     gin.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
     The number of polygons representing the spherical surface is proportional
     to (slices*stacks).
